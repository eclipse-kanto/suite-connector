# Eclipse Kanto - Suite Connector

The suite connector is the main coordination center which forwards the local
and remote messages. Messages processed by the suite connector will
typically be related to telemetry data from the devices or command &
control from the cloud. Additionally, the connector is responsible for
announcing the provisioning thing information to the local MQTT broker
subscribers.
